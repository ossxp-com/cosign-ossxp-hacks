Next step:
	0. Dynamically generate a host key, solely for encrypting
	the stream.  This is useless, unless you save the generated
	host key on the server, and "finger print" the key on each
	client, a la ssh.  This is pretty close to distributing a
	CA.

(done)	1. Give server a host key.  Connection is then encrypted,
	but nothing is authenticated.

(done)	2. Give client a CA cert.  Client can then verify server.
	Server still doesn't know who client is.

(done)	3. Give client a cert, make server ask for and verify client
	cert.

	Still need to parse the X509_NAME stuff.

Both:
SSL_CTX_set_verify
	On the server, set this to require a client cert.  On the
	client, merely verify the server.  We may need to write
	our own verify_callback()

SSL_CTX_use_certificate.3 SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file
	Load file of certs.
SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file
	Load private key.  Note that private key, root CA, and host
	cert should all be able to be stored in one file.

Client:
SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations
	Both?  Do I need this?  I think both.  I think maybe we
	don't need SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file at all, but
	this function, instead.

Server:
SSL_load_client_CA_file
SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list
	These are used to tell the client which CA's can verify
	this server, e.g. Verisign and CREN.  We get this from the
	cert file.  E.g.:

        SSL_CTX *ctx;
        STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *cert_names;

        ...
        cert_names = SSL_load_client_CA_file("/path/to/CAfile.pem");
        if (cert_names != NULL)
          SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(ctx, cert_names);
        else
          error_handling();
        ...

To keep configure from unnecessarily checking for CPP, egrep, STD C headers,
and 9 additional headers, the following change has been made to libtool.m4:
