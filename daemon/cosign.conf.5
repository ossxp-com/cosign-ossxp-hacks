.SH NAME
.B cosign.conf
\- Cookie Sign-On Daemons and CGI configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B _COSIGN_CONF
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _COSIGN_CONF file is a general purpose configuration file for
cosign.cgi, the logout cgi, cosignd, and monster. It is a whitespace delimited
line-oriented file. The first argument is always a keyword, followed by
a value, followed by optional per-keyword additional values. The
keywords
.B service
and
.B cgi
are unique to cosignd. The keywords
.B set
and
.B include
are used by both daemons and both cgis. Finally the keywords
.BR cookie ,
.BR cert ,
.BR factor ,
.B negotiate
and
.B suffix
are used by cosign.cgi.
.sp
.SH CGI and SERVICE
Each line contains a keyword, which is the role of the client in the
cosign system -
.B cgi
or
.BR service .
Next is the subject CN (common name). The third argument, which is a
flag [P,T,PT,0] to signify if the host with the listed subject CN can
ask for Kerberos tickets (T), proxy cookies (P), both(PT), or none (0) .
If proxy cookies are authorized (P), the fourth argument is the name of
a file that contains the hostname and servicename for the proxy cookies,
one per line, white space delimited (see Example). Lines that are blank or
begin with '#' are ignored. '*' is a wildcard and will match any string.
.sp 
A client's CN must match a line in the configuration file, otherwise it
is not permitted to talk to cosignd. All clients must call STARTTLS
before any other commands can be issued. Clients can only issue commands
associated with their keyword.
.sp
The keyword
.B CGI
allows clients to use the
.BR LOGIN ,
.BR CHECK ,
.BR REGISTER ,
.BR RETRIEVE ,
.BR TIME ,
.BR DAEMON ,
and
.B LOGOUT
commands. 
.sp
The keyword
.B service
allows clients to use the
.B CHECK
and
.B RETRIEVE
commands (see cosignd(8)).
.sp
.SH "SET" CONFIG FILE OPTIONS - SHARED
The following configuration file options are recognised for use with the
keyword
.BR SET .
Configuration file options override the default compile time settings, but are in turn overridden by any command line options as specified.
.TP 19
.B cosigncadir
The location where CA certificates in hashed form after expected to reside for validating client ceriticates. This is overridden by the
.B \-x
command line option, and the default is _COSIGN_TLS_CADIR
.TP 19
.B cosigncert
The location of the SSL server certificate for use by this program. This is overridden by the
.B \-y
command line option and the defualt is _COSIGN_TLS_CERT
.TP 19
.BI cosignkey
The location of the SSL key file for use by this program. This is overridden by the
.B \-z
command line option and the default is _COSIGN_TLS_KEY
.SH "SET" CONFIG FILE OPTIONS - DAEMON
.TP 19
.B cosigndb
The cosign daemon directory, where all cookies (cosign= and cosign-serv=) will be stored. This is overridden by the
.B \-D
command line option and the default is _COSIGN_DIR
.TP 19
.B cosigndbhashlen
This is the length of the subdirectory hash in cosignd's cookie cache
_COSIGN_DIR. The default is 0, which means all cookies are written to
the top level of _COSIGN_DIR. A value of 1 means cosignd will use 64
subdirectories, that is a-z, A-Z, 0-9, +, and - (this is only 38 on a
case-insensitive filesystem) to store the cookie cache. A value of 2
means cosignd will use 4096 subdirectories, similar to thr previous
example but with 2 character directory names (this is only 1444 on a
case-insensitive filesystem) to store the cookie cache. These
subdirectories must be created by the administrator (see
SCRIPTS/dbhash).
.TP 19
.B cosignhost
The hostname to replicate to. This "turns on" cosignd's replication.
This is overridden by the
.B \-h
command line option and the default is off and "NULL"
.TP 19
.B cosigndticketcache
The path to the directory where cosignd stores the kerberos tickets sent
by cosign.cgi. If nothing is set here, the default value is _COSIGN_TICKET_CACHE
.TP 19
.B cosignnettimeout
This is the amount of time alotted by cosignd for each network
transaction. The default is 4 minutes.
.TP 19
.B cosignport
This is the port on which cosignd listens. The default is 6663.
.sp
.SH "SET" CONFIG FILE OPTIONS - CGIs
.TP 19
.B cosignkrbtkts
This can be set to "on" or "off". Governs whether an external 
HTTP-Negotiate or x509 login should attempt to transfer kerberos 
tickets. The default is "off".
.TP 19
.B cosignticketcache
The path to the directory where cosign.cgi stores the kerberos tickets
it generates upon successful kerberos login. These tickets are deleted
once the ticket has been successfully transfered to cosignd. This
setting is also the default path for the directory where cosignd stores
its tickets, and the default is _COSIGN_TICKET_CACHE
.TP 19
.B cosigntmpldir
The path to the directory where cosign.cgi gets the templates for
drawing the screen. This is therefore the working directory for
cosign.cgi. The default is _COSIGN_TMPL_DIR
.TP 19
.B cosignx509krbtkts
Synonymous with cosignkrbtkts.
.TP 19
.B cosignkeytab
This is the path to the keytab file keytab with the principal of "cosign" and
the instance of the hostname of the machine that the cgi will run on. This
keytab is used during authentication to verify that KDC spoofing is not
happening  <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1616> and must therefore be
readable by the UID the CGI runs as (usually the same as your web server).
The path to this file can be set at compile time using the
 --with-keytabpath=FILE configure option, during runtime with this
cosignkeytab setting or
.IR krb5_kt_default_name (3)
will be used at run time to identify the default keytab file for the uid
running the CGI. The default it "NULL"
.TP 19
.B cosignlogouturl
This is the URL the logout cgi will redirect a user to upon successful
completion of logout. It can be overriden by passing a URL on the query
string to the logout cgi, as in
http://cosign.edu/cosign-bin/logout?http://go.here.now.edu
and the default is _COSIGN_LOGOUT_URL.
.TP 19
.B cosignloopurl
This is the page a browser is redirected to when cosign.cgi detects
there is a loop. The complied-in defaults define a loop as visiting
cosign.cgi more than 10 (MAXLOOPCOUNT) times in 30 (LOOPWINDOW) seconds.
The default is _COSIGN_LOOP_URL
.sp
.SH "SET" CONFIG FILE OPTIONS - CGI with Cosign Friend
The following three options are for use with Cosign Friend which is now a
separate release, though the cgi in this release of Cosign must be built
with friend support on.
.TP 19
.B mysqldb
The hostname of friend's database server. The default is _FRIEND_MYSQL_DB
.TP 19
.B mysqluser
The login name to access the friend database. The default is
_FRIEND_MYSQL_LOGIN
.TP 19
.B mysqlpasswd
The password to access the friend database. The default is
_FRIEND_MYSQL_PASSWD
.sp
.SH INCLUDE
The keyword
.I include
allows an administrator to build a cosign configuration file by
aggregating the contents of several smaller files. The first argument is
the keyword followed by the path to the file to include.
.sp
.SH COOKIE
The keyword 
.I cookie
takes 2 arguments - a service cookie prefix (eg. cosign-mail) and an
"function". The only currently defined function is "reauth" but
more options may be added when the cgi's functionality is extended. This
keyword is currently used to denote a cosign service that requires
reauthentication before a
.B REGISTER
can succeed.
.sp
With Cosign 2.0, there is the option to indicate that multiple
factors are required for reauthentication. After the function "reauth"
there can be up to 5 factor names. When a user is asked to re-authenticate,
s/he must supply the correct information to every factor that is
configured here in the single POST. If the user types any information
wrong, s/he must type in everything again.
.sp
If there are no factors configured for reauthentication, the cgi will
accept any factor the user can satisfy.
.sp
.SH CERT
The keyword
.I cert
is used to authenticate a user with an x509 certificate. It takes 5
fields - keyword, issuer_dn, subject_dn, login, and factor (see
Example).  The issuer_dn must be an exact match  of the environment
variable SSL_CLIENT_I_DN.  The next field, subject_dn, is a regular
expression which matches SSL_CLIENT_S_DN.  (Note that the configuration
file parser interprets backslashes, so in the example section we have
"escaped" our backslashes. The first backslash escapes the second
backslash which is then passed onto the regular expression parser.)  The
login and factor fields may contain $1, $2, and/or $3, which are
replaced with the corresponding parenthesized subexpressions of the
regular expression subject_dn.
.sp
.SH FACTOR
The keyword
.I factor
is used to invoke the external authenticator API. It takes the keyword,
the pathname to the executable, and a list of form-fields, maximum of 5
(see Example).  If all listed form-fields contain posted data, then the
CGI invokes the external authenticator. The value of each form-field is
written to the external authenticator on stdin (file descriptor 0), one
per line, in the order they are listed in the configuration. If
authentication is successful, the external authenticator writes the
factor name on stdout (file descriptor 1) and exits with a value of 0.
If an error occurs, the external authenticator writes an error message
on stdout and exits with a value of 1. All other exit values are
reserved for future use.
.sp
There are currently two additional configuration options.  The -2 option
to the factor keyword means that this factor is only checked after
another (non -2) factor has been satisfied.  It is intended for use with
factors that are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks due to repeated
authentication failures. The other configuration option uses the keyword
.I suffix.
.sp
.SH NEGOTIATE
The keyword
.I negotiate
is used to authenticate a user using HTTP-Negotiate authentication. It 
takes 4 fields - keyword, regexp, login, and factor.  The regular 
expression regexp is matched against the REMOTE_USER variable 
provided by the web server. (Note that the 
configuration file parser interprets backslashes.)
The login and factor fields may contain $1, $2, and/or $3, 
which are replaced with the corresponding parenthesized subexpressions 
of the regular expression.
.sp
.SH PASSWD
The keyword
.I passwd
is used to control password based authentication of a user using the 
Kerberos and MySQL internal authenticators. Where this keyword is not
specified, usernames containing an '@' are authenticated through mysql,
all other usernames are authenticated with Kerberos. The keyword takes
5 fields - keyword, type, regexp, login and factor. The regular
expression regexp is matched against the username supplied by the user.
(Note that the configuration parser interprets backslashes, so these
must be escaped, as in the examples below). The login and factor fields
may contain $1, $2 and/or $3 which are replaced with the corresponding
parethesized subexpressions of the regular expression. The CGI uses the
first password line whose regular expression matches the username, and
calls the internal authenticator specified by the 'type' field (which may
be either 'kerberos' or 'mysql'), with the login name given by the login
field. Should this login be successful, the user is marked as being
authenticated by the factor contained in the factor field.

.SH SUFFIX
The keyword
.I suffix
takes 2 arguments - the keyword and a string, such as "-junk" (see
Example). This configuration
causes cosign.cgi to remove the "-junk" suffix from any
server-provided factors before comparison with required 
factors.  For example, if the cgi is checking the factor "OTP", and
ignores the suffix "-junk", and the user has authenticated 
with the factor "OTP-junk", then the cgi's authentication factor
requirements would be fulfilled. This option is paired with the cosign
filter's CosignFactorSuffix and CosignFactorSuffixIgnore and is
essentially here to support Michigan's phased roll out of one time
passwords.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example of _COSIGN_CONF defines 2 cgis and several
services. It also overrides the built in values for the cosign key file
and where cosignd stores kerberos tickets.
